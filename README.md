### Work Experience

#### Freelance Software Developer
_October 2018 - Present_

#### Satchel Health, Full-Stack Developer
_July 2016 - July 2018_

I came onboard to setup a testing suite for Satchel's main client-side
application written in React and to take over front-end development.  I
progressed to becoming the maintainer of an event-driven back-end API,
written in Node.js using a proprietary event-sourcing library.  I
designed and implemented an electronic health record system integration
microservice in Golang.  Then I co-designed and implemented a mobile
application written in React Native.  I architected and implemented a
real time communication websocket server in Golang.  I wrote a
JavaScript client API for this and configured its infrastructure in AWS
using Terraform.  I architected and implemented a prototype medical
video chat application using the Chrome MediaStream API, Twilio Video,
RxJS, React and Redux.  This chat integrated media streams coming from
digital medical devices, patient intake data, and video.  I interviewed
and trained two junior developers, onboarding them to this project,
which we built to completion.  I set up continuous integration for this
project using Travis CI and configured its deployment using Terraform.

#### Work Institute, Junior Full-Stack Developer
_October 2015 - July 2016_

The epic task was to progressively replace a legacy system.  Primarily,
I worked on an ETL application to translate data in various formats from
clients into the format of Work Institute's database schema.  This
included building a UI to create the translation map and setting
standards for the format of incoming data from clients.  I set up
continuous integration / continuous deployment of this app to a test
server.  In production, the application was deployed to a Windows server
using IIS.  I also recruited, onboarded and mentored a junior developer.
