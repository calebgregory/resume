### Work Experience

#### Freelance Software Developer
_October 2018 - Present_

#### Satchel Health, Full-Stack Developer
_July 2016 - July 2018_

I came onboard to setup a testing suite for Satchel's main client-side
application written in React and to take over front-end development.  I
progressed to becoming the maintainer of an event-driven backend API,
written in Node.js using a proprietary event-sourcing library.  I
designed and implemented an electronic health record integration
microservice in Golang.  Then I co-designed and implemented a mobile
application written in React Native.  I architected and implemented a
real time communication websocket server in Golang, for which I wrote a
JavaScript client.  I architected and worked with a team of developers
to create a medical video-chat application using Twilio Video, RxJS,
React and Redux, which also integrated media streams coming from
medical devices.  I set up continuous integration for this project using
Travis CI.

#### Work Institute, Junior Full-Stack Developer
_October 2015 - July 2016_

The epic task was to progressively replace a legacy system.  Primarily,
I worked on an ETL application to translate data in various formats from
clients into the format of Work Institute's database schema.  This
included creating a UI to create the translation map.  I set up
continuous integration / continuous deployment to a test server.  The
application was deployed for production to a Windows server using IIS.
I also recruited, onboarded and mentored a junior developer.
